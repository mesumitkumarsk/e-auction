# **E-Auction System**

The **E-Auction System** is designed to facilitate seamless online auctions by automating key processes such as item listing, bidding, and user management. It provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for both bidders and administrators to manage auctions effectively.

This project is a Java-based E-Auction System that utilizes a MySQL database for data storage and management. The project consists of the following key files:

---

## **Files**

### **E-Auction.sql**
This SQL file contains the database schema required for the E-Auction System. It includes:
- Table definitions for storing auction item details, bid records, user information, and other critical entities.
- Sample data to test the system and facilitate initial setup.
- SQL queries that initialize the tables, relationships, and constraints required for the system's functioning.

### **JDBC Conn.java**
This Java file establishes a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It includes:
- Configuration for database URL, username, and password.
- Methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
- Functions for handling user inputs and interactions with the database, enabling seamless integration between the frontend interface and backend database.
